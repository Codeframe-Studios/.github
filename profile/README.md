# CodeFrame Studios

Welcome to **CodeFrame Studios**. You’ve arrived at the edge of something unknown, something that has yet to be fully understood. Our journey has just begun, and the road ahead is shrouded in mystery.

## Our Projects

### 1. **Main**
It begins with **Main**. But this is just the surface. What lies beneath? The puzzle is far from solved.

- **Released**: Available now.
- **Features**:
  - A language that speaks in ways you haven’t yet heard.
  - A foundation set for things unimaginable.

### Teasers: The Future Unfolds

- **Project X**: It’s more than a collection. It’s an ecosystem, quietly shaping the future. What happens when you unlock everything that’s hidden inside? How will it transform what’s already been built? You’ll find out when the pieces fall into place.

- **NightOwl**: A space where creation meets vision. But this isn’t just an IDE. It’s a new dimension for innovation. Every tool, every line of code, reimagined. What happens when it changes how you see the world? Keep watching.

- **CodeBit**: We can’t say much. But when the time comes, it will change software development forever. It’s more than just a tool—it’s a force that will reshape everything. You aren’t ready. But when it arrives, everything will change.

We can’t say much… yet. The whispers are just beginning.

## CodeFrame Studios' Vision

You thought you understood what was possible. We’re about to show you that you don’t. Our creations aren’t meant to fit into the world—they are meant to break it, to reshape it into something entirely new. **Main** is the beginning, but it is only the first piece of a much larger puzzle.

What we are building will shift everything you know about development. But it won’t be explained. You will have to see it to believe it.

## Get Involved

The doors are open, but only for those ready to explore what’s beyond:

- **Contribute**: The pieces are here. Are you ready to help put them together? Find us on GitHub.
- **Report Issues**: We don’t believe in perfection, only evolution. Help us shape what’s to come.
- **Stay Updated**: The whispers will grow louder. Watch for the signs.
